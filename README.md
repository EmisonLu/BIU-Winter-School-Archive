# BIU-Winter-School-Archive
The slides of BIU winter school.

The official website of [BIU Winter School](https://cyber.biu.ac.il/event/the-13th-biu-winter-school-on-cryptography/) frequently crashes (to the best of my knowledge, it has been inaccessible for quite some time). This repository serves as an archive for the relevant slides, but regrettably, I haven't saved all of them. If you happen to have the missing slides, could you please consider submitting a pull request (PR) to share the resources with the community? Thanks!
